# Server Rules & Guidelines

Please follow these simple rules closely to ensure a positive experience for everyone using this media server (Jellyfin: *Parvati* / Plex: *Mahadev*).

## 1. Do Not Share Your Account or Discuss the Server Publicly

Sharing your account credentials (username/password) with others is **strictly prohibited**. Please also maintain discretion about this server's existence and your access to it.

* **Why?**
    * Server resources (like transcoding power provided by the  CPU & GPU, plus network bandwidth) are shared among active users. Adding unauthorized users via shared accounts can significantly slow down streaming performance and cause buffering for everyone.
    * Maintaining privacy and discretion helps ensure the long-term availability of this service.

* **Consequences for Account Sharing:**
    * *First Occurrence:* Temporary account lockout (e.g., 24 Hours)
    * *Second Occurrence:* Longer lockout (e.g., 1 Week)
    * *Third Occurrence:* Account disabled until you contact the administrator.

Essentially: **DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SERVER OR SHARE YOUR ACCOUNT!**
