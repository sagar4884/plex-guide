# How to Report a Problem with a Movie or TV Show

If you encounter any problems with content while using Jellyfin (such as distorted video, incorrect media, double images, audio sync issues, or misaligned subtitles), you have two ways to report it:

**1. Using the Requesting Tool (Preferred):**

This method is preferred as it helps track and resolve issues more effectively by creating a searchable history.

1.  Visit **[request.bladelight.tech](https://request.bladelight.tech)** (You may need to log in).
2.  Find the problematic Movie or TV Show using the search function.
3.  Click on the item to view its details.
4.  Look for a **Report Issue** button or icon (often a yellow exclamation point ⚠️ or similar). Click it.
5.  Clearly describe the problem you experienced (e.g., "Audio out of sync starting at 10 minutes", "Wrong episode for S02E03", "Subtitles disappear after 30 minutes").
6.  Submit the report.

*(Optional: Include the embedded Guidejar tutorial from your original doc here if it's still relevant)*
**Why use the Requesting Tool for reporting?**

* Creates a documented history of the issue.
* Helps me track problems I can't fix immediately.
* Makes it easier to identify patterns in content issues.
* Provides all the necessary details in one place.

**2. Direct Contact:**

* You can always contact me directly (via [Preferred Contact Method - e.g., Discord, Email]) about any issues.
* This is perfectly fine too! Please provide the name of the Movie/Show and a description of the problem.

Thank you for helping keep the library in good shape!
