This guide details common tasks you'll need to perform when using the media server (Jellyfin: *Parvati* / Plex: *Mahadev*) for the first time or troubleshooting issues. The content herein should answer most of your questions, though you're always welcome to ask me directly. While this guide primarily shows screenshots from a web browser, you can make configuration changes from most client apps (mobile, smart TV, or game console). If you have trouble finding a particular setting, switching to a web browser is often easier.

Most settings sync across your devices once configured, with one important exception: **streaming quality must be set separately the first time you log into each new client application.**
<br><br>
While you don't need to read this guide from start to finish, **new users** should at least review these essential sections:

* [Connecting to the Server](connecting.md) (How to log in, especially with Jellyfin)
* [Client Playback Settings](client-settings.md) (Crucial for best quality!)
* [Request Content & Problem Reporting](https://request.bladelight.tech): for guide on how use: [Requesting Content & Reporting Issues](requests-and-issues.md)

Wondering why we moved to Jellyfin (*Parvati*)? Read about [the advantages for you](why-jellyfin.md).
