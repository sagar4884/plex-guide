# Jellyfin vs. Plex: Key Advantages of Jellyfin

When choosing a media server, both Jellyfin and Plex offer robust solutions, but they differ significantly in philosophy and features. If you're considering Jellyfin, here are some of its key advantages compared to Plex:

## 1. Completely Free and Open Source (FOSS)

* **No Costs, Ever:** Jellyfin is 100% free. There are no premium tiers, subscriptions (like Plex Pass), or features hidden behind a paywall. Everything is included out of the box.
* **Transparency:** Being open-source means the code is publicly available for anyone to inspect, audit, modify, and contribute to. This fosters trust and community involvement.
* **Community Driven:** Development is driven by the community, focusing on features desired by its users rather than corporate priorities.

## 2. Enhanced Privacy

* **No Telemetry:** Jellyfin does not collect usage data or metrics from your server by default. Your viewing habits and library information remain private on your server.
* **No Central Servers Required:** Core functionality does not rely on external servers controlled by the Jellyfin project (unlike Plex, which requires authentication via Plex.tv). Your server can run entirely independently on your local network if desired.

## 3. Full Access to Features (Including Hardware Transcoding)

* **Hardware Transcoding for Free:** Jellyfin allows all users to leverage hardware acceleration (like Intel Quick Sync Video or NVIDIA NVENC on your RTX 2080 Super) for transcoding without any extra cost. Plex requires a paid Plex Pass subscription for this feature.
* **No Feature Gating:** All server features, administrative controls, and playback capabilities are available to every user without restriction.

## 4. Greater Customization and Control

* **More Flexibility:** The open-source nature allows for deeper customization, including theming via custom CSS and a wider range of community-developed plugins for various functionalities.
* **Full Control Over Updates:** You decide when and if to update your server software. You are not forced into updates that might change features or UI elements unexpectedly.
* **Direct File Access Focus:** Jellyfin primarily focuses on serving *your* media library directly, without integrating third-party ad-supported streaming services into the interface.

## 5. Offline Authentication

* **Local Logins:** User authentication happens directly against your server. You can log in and use Jellyfin even if your internet connection is down or if external authentication services were unavailable (provided you are on the same local network).

While Plex has its own strengths, particularly in client app availability and potentially a more polished out-of-the-box UI for some users, Jellyfin's commitment to being free, open-source, and privacy-respecting offers compelling advantages for users who value control and transparency.
