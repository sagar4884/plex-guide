# Setting Video Quality (Web Browser)

To ensure the best possible video quality and avoid unnecessary transcoding when using Jellyfin in a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) on your computer, follow these steps:

1.  **Login:** Log in to the Jellyfin server at `https://jellyfin.bladelight.tech`.
2.  **Open Settings:** Click on the **User Icon** (usually your profile picture or initial) in the top-right corner of the page.
3.  **Select Dashboard:** From the dropdown menu, choose **Dashboard**. (*Note: You need to be an Administrator to access the Dashboard.* If you are not an admin, proceed to step 5).
4.  **Navigate to Playback Settings (Admin):** In the Dashboard menu on the left, go to **Playback**. Here, you can set server-wide defaults if desired, but client-side settings often override these.
5.  **Open User Settings:** Click on the **User Icon** in the top-right corner again.
6.  **Select Settings:** From the dropdown menu, choose **Settings**.
7.  **Select Playback:** In the user settings menu on the left, click on **Playback**.
8.  **Adjust Quality Settings:** Find the section related to streaming quality (it might be labeled "Streaming" or similar). Set the following options:
    * **Internet Streaming Quality / Remote Quality:** Set this to the **Maximum** possible value (e.g., often represented by the highest bitrate number or an option like "Maximum" or "Original"). This tells Jellyfin to request the original file quality when streaming outside your home network.
    * **Home Network Quality / Local Quality:** Set this also to the **Maximum** possible value. This applies when streaming within your home network.
9.  **Save Changes:** Scroll down if necessary and click the **Save** button.

These settings ensure the web client requests the best quality video file, letting the server decide if transcoding is truly necessary based on device compatibility or bandwidth limitations, rather than forcing a lower quality by default.
