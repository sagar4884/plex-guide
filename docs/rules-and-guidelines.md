# <span style="color:orange">Rules and Guidelines for using Plex</span>

There are only 2 rules please follow them closely:

<span style="color:orange">1. **Don't Talk About Plex or Share Your Account:**</span> <br>

  Sharing your account with others can cause your account to be banned from my server (server space is limited, also the more people that are on the more your services will lag).
   
  * First Occurrence - 24 Hour Lock Out<br>
  * Second Occurrence - 1 Week Lock Out<br>
  * Third Occurrence - Will be banned until you contact the administrator<br>

<span style="color:orange">2.  **DON'T TALK ABOUT PLEX OR SHARE YOUR ACCOUNT!!** </span>
