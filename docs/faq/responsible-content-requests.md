# Responsible Content Requesting

## Understanding How Plex Works
Unlike streaming services like Netflix or Disney+, my Plex server runs on physical hardware at my home. Every Movie and TV Show you request is stored on hard drives that I maintain and pay for. While I'm happy to provide this service, it's important to understand that storage space isn't infinite!

## Request Guidelines
I encourage you to request content you're genuinely interested in watching. Here are some tips for responsible requesting:

* Try to watch content you've requested
* Consider pacing your requests with your viewing habits
* Feel free to request whatever interests you, but be mindful of requesting large amounts of content you may not get to

## Life Happens
I completely understand that:

* You might lose interest in something you requested
* Life gets busy and you can't watch everything
* Your viewing preferences might change

This is all perfectly normal! These guidelines aren't strict rules - they're just to help everyone understand how the server works and to make the most of our shared resource.

## Questions?
If you're unsure about requesting something or have questions about how much to request, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always happy to help!

!!! note
    Remember: This is a free service I provide because I enjoy sharing content with friends and family. Being mindful of your requests helps me maintain the server effectively for everyone.
