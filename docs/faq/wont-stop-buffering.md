# My video won't stop buffering

If you're experiencing constant buffering, there are two common solutions:

### 1. Lower Your Streaming Quality {: .no-toc }

Your internet connection might need a lower quality setting:

* Your internet speed might not support maximum resolution streaming
* Try reducing the quality to 1080p or 720p
* See the [Changing Plex streaming quality](../changing-stream-quality/index.md) page for detailed instructions on changing the streaming quality for different devices

### 2. Check Your Subtitles {: .no-toc }

Subtitle processing can cause buffering:

* Plex can sometimes struggle with subtitle processing
* If you have subtitles enabled, try disabling them temporarily
* This often resolves buffering issues immediately
