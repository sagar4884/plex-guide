# Why do I need to buy the Plex app on my phone?

!!! quote

    Our mobile apps (Android and iOS) can be used for free, but have limitations. Until the mobile app is unlocked (through an in-app purchase or a Plex Pass subscription), video and music streamed from a Plex Media Server has a 1 minute playback limit, and photos will be watermarked.
