# Missing Confirmation Emails

## Expected Notifications
When you request content, you should receive two automated emails:

1. Request approval confirmation
2. Content availability notification when ready to stream

## Troubleshooting Missing Emails
If you're not receiving these notifications, it's likely because:

- You may have signed up for Plex using an old or inactive email address
- Your email settings in Plex need to be updated

## How to Update Your Email
To fix this, you'll need to update the email address associated with your Plex account.
