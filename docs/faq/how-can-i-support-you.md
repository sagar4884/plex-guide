# Supporting the Server

## Donations
My Plex server is and will always be completely free. No donations or payments will ever be accepted - just enjoy the content!

## Plex Pass (Optional)
If you're enjoying Plex, you might want to consider getting a [Plex Pass](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/). While I don't receive any compensation, it offers several premium features:

* Download content for offline viewing
* Auto-skip intros and credits
* Access to Live TV
* And more!

### Plex Pass Subscription Options
- Monthly: Around $5
- **Recommended:** Lifetime subscription
    - Usually $120
    - Often discounted to $80-90 during Black Friday sales
    - Best value if you plan to use Plex long-term

!!! note
    Plex Pass is completely optional - you don't need it to access and enjoy my server's content.
