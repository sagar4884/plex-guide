# How do I add items to my Plex Universal Watchlist?

!!! quote
    It’s easy to add content to your Universal Watchlist from a number of places:

    - Movies or TV shows in a Plex Media Server library (not individual seasons or episodes)
    - Plex’s free Movies & Shows streaming content
    - Content you find in the Discover source
    - Via the player when watching trailers

    From any of those sources:

    - On Movie and TV show library or universal detail screens, you click on the Add to Watchlist button
    - On mobile and TV grid views you can long press on a Movie or show poster to see the Add to Watchlist option
    - In the web app click on the options menu on the bottom right of a trailer, show or movie poster/thumb
    - From search results menu in the desktop/web app click the menu to the right of each result
    - During trailer playback from the Discover source an Add to Watchlist button is located on near the playback controls
    - If you select a non-Plex streaming service to watch a TV show from the universal details page, when you return to Plex it will ask you if you want to add that show to your Watchlist so you can quickly access the show in the future to watch more episodes. Plex can automatically remove shows and movies from the Watchlist if played within Plex Movies & Shows. Items watched on other services will need to be managed manually.

    If an item is already on your Watchlist, the option will be displayed as Remove from Watchlist.
