# What is Transcoding?

!!! quote "What is transcoding?"
    Great question, Transcoding is Plex's secret sauce. It makes sure that whatever the device you are on, it will transcode the tiny bits that make up a video into a format that your client can understand and display. This is true for both video and audio formats.

    ## Why is Transcoding not preferred?
    Another great question. Transcoding effects picture quality while also taking adverse effects on the server that is sending the digital bits. It has to shrink the bits and then send them to your client. Imagine if it didn't have to change the bits? It just sent them.

    ## What's in it for me?
    Quicker loading times, you press play and the video will start sooner than if the server had to change all the bits. Faster video scrubbing (Fast FWD/RWD), meaning skipping ahead and rewinding will be quicker. More people can enjoy the server if the server doesn't have to work as hard and you get the highest quality picture you can. Hence this site was created to educate users on the optimal settings for Plex for the best experience.
