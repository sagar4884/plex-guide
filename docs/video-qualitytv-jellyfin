# Setting Video Quality (Android TV / Google TV / Fire TV App)

To ensure the best video quality and prevent unnecessary transcoding on devices like Nvidia Shield, Chromecast with Google TV, Amazon Fire TV sticks, or TVs running Android TV/Google TV, adjust the settings within the Jellyfin app:

1.  **Open Jellyfin App:** Launch the Jellyfin application on your TV device.
2.  **Navigate to Settings:** Use your remote control to navigate to the **Settings** menu. This is often represented by a **Gear icon** ⚙️, typically found in the sidebar menu (you might need to scroll down or press left/right to reveal it) or sometimes under your user profile icon.
3.  **Select Playback:** Within the Settings menu, find and select the **Playback** or **Client Settings** > **Playback** section.
4.  **Adjust Video Quality:** Look for settings related to video quality over different network types:
    * **Maximum Streaming Bitrate / Remote Bitrate:** Find the setting for streaming quality when *outside* your home network (often called "Remote" or "Internet"). Set this to the **highest possible value** or an option explicitly labeled **Maximum** or **Auto**. *"Auto"* in this context usually means "try direct play first", which is desirable. If "Maximum" is available, prefer that.
    * **Home Network Streaming Bitrate / Local Bitrate:** Find the setting for streaming quality when *inside* your home network (often called "Local" or "Home Network"). Set this also to the **highest possible value** or **Maximum** / **Auto**.
5.  **Check Direct Play Settings:** Ensure settings like "Allow Direct Play" or similar are **enabled**. This allows the app to play files without transcoding if they are compatible.
6.  **Save/Exit:** There might not be an explicit "Save" button; settings are often saved automatically as you change them. Navigate back out of the settings menu.

Setting the quality to maximum ensures your TV app attempts to play the original file quality whenever possible, relying on your powerful server (and GPU) to transcode only when absolutely necessary for compatibility reasons.
