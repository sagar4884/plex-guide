# Setting Video Quality (iOS Mobile App - iPhone/iPad)

To ensure the best video quality when using the official Jellyfin app (or compatible apps like Swiftfin) on your iPhone or iPad, adjust the streaming quality settings.

**Using the Official Jellyfin App:**

1.  **Open Jellyfin App:** Launch the Jellyfin application.
2.  **Navigate to Settings:** Tap on the **More** tab (often represented by three dots ...) in the bottom navigation bar.
3.  **Select Settings:** Tap on **Settings** (usually represented by a **Gear icon** ⚙️).
4.  **Select Playback:** Within the Settings menu, tap on **Playback**.
5.  **Adjust Video Quality:** Modify the following settings:
    * **Max Streaming Bitrate / Remote Bitrate:** Controls quality over cellular or external Wi-Fi. Tap and choose the **highest available bitrate** (e.g., 120 Mbps or higher) or **Maximum**.
    * **Home Network Streaming Bitrate / Local Bitrate:** Controls quality on your home Wi-Fi. Tap and choose the **highest available bitrate** or **Maximum**.
6.  **Exit Settings:** Settings typically save automatically. Navigate back.

**Using Swiftfin (Popular Alternative iOS App):**

1.  **Open Swiftfin App:** Launch Swiftfin.
2.  **Navigate to Settings:** Tap the **Settings** tab (Gear icon ⚙️) in the bottom navigation bar.
3.  **Select Playback:** Under the Playback section, adjust the quality:
    * **Remote Quality:** Tap and select the **highest bitrate** or **Maximum**.
    * **Local Quality:** Tap and select the **highest bitrate** or **Maximum**.
4.  **Exit Settings:** Settings save automatically.

Choosing the maximum quality setting allows the app to request the original file, reducing unnecessary transcoding on the server.
