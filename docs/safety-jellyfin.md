# Is Connecting to the Jellyfin Server Safe?

Yes, connecting to and using the Jellyfin server at `https://jellyfin.bladelight.tech` is safe.

* **Secure Connection:** Your connection to the server uses **HTTPS**, meaning all data transferred between your device and the server (including your login credentials and what you watch) is encrypted. This is similar to the security used for online banking. The security certificate is automatically managed and kept up-to-date.
* **Privacy Focused:** As outlined in [Why Jellyfin?](why-jellyfin.md), Jellyfin is designed with privacy in mind. The server software itself does not report your viewing habits or personal data back to any central company by default. All your interaction data stays between your client app and this server instance.
* **No Account Sharing:** Your individual login ensures that your watch history and settings are tied to your account only (unless you share your password, which is against the rules).

You can stream with confidence knowing the connection is secure and your activity isn't being tracked by external parties via the media server software itself.
