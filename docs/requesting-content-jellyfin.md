# Requesting Content

You can request new Movies or TV Shows using the dedicated requesting tool:

1.  Visit **[request.bladelight.tech](https://request.bladelight.tech)** and log in.
2.  Search for the Movie or TV Show you'd like to add.
3.  Click the **Request** button for the desired item.

Requests are typically reviewed regularly. If the content is available and approved, it should appear in the Jellyfin library shortly after. Availability depends on digital release dates and sources.

*(Note: The concept of a "Universal Watchlist" automatically triggering requests like in Plex might work differently or require specific configuration in tools like Overseerr/Jellyseerr when connected to Jellyfin. Check the requesting tool's interface for any watchlist import/sync features if you use them.)*

!!! important "Login Requirement for Requesting Tool Features"
    Some features of the requesting tool (like potential watchlist syncing or seeing request status) might require you to log into **[request.bladelight.tech](https://request.bladelight.tech)** periodically (e.g., at least once every 90 days, depending on the tool's settings) for it to maintain connection with your account or sync data.
