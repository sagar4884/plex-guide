# Basic Navigation & Libraries

Welcome! Once you're connected to the Jellyfin (*Parvati*) server (see [Connecting to the Server](connecting.md)), here's a quick guide to finding your way around the interface in most Jellyfin apps.

!!! note "Interface Variations"
    The exact layout might differ slightly between apps (Web browser, TV app, Mobile app), but the core concepts are generally the same.

## Finding Your Way Around

* **Home Screen:** This is usually your starting point after logging in. It often shows:
    * **Continue Watching:** Shows you started but haven't finished.
    * **Next Up:** The next episode in TV series you're currently watching.
    * **Latest Media:** Recently added movies or episodes in specific libraries.
    * *(Customizable)* You can often customize the sections and libraries shown on your home screen via the app's **Settings > Home Screen**.

* **Sidebar / Menu:** Most apps have a main menu, often accessed via:
    * A "Hamburger" icon (‚ò∞) on mobile/web (usually top-left).
    * A persistent sidebar on the left in TV/desktop apps.
    This menu provides direct access to the different media libraries.

* **Libraries:** These are the main categories of content. Select a library name (e.g., "Movies", "TV Shows") from the menu or home screen to browse its contents. Inside a library, you can usually sort (by name, date added, release date, etc.) and filter (by genre, year, etc.).

* **Search:** Look for a **Magnifying Glass icon** (üîç), typically near the top of the screen or in the main menu. This allows you to search across all your accessible libraries for specific titles, actors, directors, etc.

* **User Icon / Settings:** Your profile icon (often top-right or in the main menu) usually gives access to:
    * **Settings:** Adjust client-specific options like playback quality (see [Client Playback Settings](client-settings.md)), interface appearance, subtitles, etc.
    * **Logout:** Option to log out of the server.

## Library Descriptions

Here's a brief overview of the different media libraries available on the *Parvati* server:

* **Anime:** Features Japanese animated series and movies, covering a wide range of genres and styles from classics to recent releases.
* **R Anime:** Contains mature-rated (R or 18+) anime series and movies. This library is intended for adult audiences due to potentially explicit content (violence, themes, language, etc.). Viewer discretion is advised.
* **TV Shows:** Your main library for episodic television series, primarily Western/English-language shows across various genres (comedy, drama, sci-fi, reality, etc.).
* **Asian Shows:** Features television dramas and series originating from various Asian countries (e.g., Korea, China, Japan, Thailand), excluding anime. Includes K-Dramas, C-Dramas, J-Dramas, and more.
* **Shorts:** A collection of short films (live-action or animated), standalone specials, or brief video clips that don't fit into standard movie or TV categories.
* **Audio Books:** Contains narrated book recordings for listening enjoyment, typically organized by author or title. Use a compatible Jellyfin music client (like Finamp on mobile) or the web player for the best experience.
* **Movies:** Your primary collection of feature-length films, mostly Western/English-language releases across different genres (action, comedy, drama, horror, thriller, etc.).
* **Indian Shows:** Dedicated library for television series and shows produced in India, covering various regional languages and popular genres.
* **Indian Movies:** Features feature-length films originating from India (Bollywood, Tollywood, Kollywood etc.), encompassing diverse languages and cinematic styles.
* **Foreign Movies:** Contains non-English language feature films from around the world (excluding Indian cinema, which has its own libraries). Subtitles are generally available and recommended.
* **Documentary:** Feature-length non-fiction films exploring real-world topics, events, nature, history, science, biographies, or people.
* **Documentary Shows:** Episodic non-fiction television series covering various subjects, similar to the Documentary movie library but in a multi-part series format.
* **Live Channels:** *(Requires compatible client)* Access live broadcast television channels available through the server's configured tuner or IPTV source. Channel availability may vary.
* **Collections:** Contains curated groups of movies or shows linked by a theme, franchise, actor, or director (e.g., "Marvel Cinematic Universe", "James Bond Collection", "Studio Ghibli Films"). These help organize related content scattered across other libraries and provide easy access to series or themed movie sets.

Explore the libraries and use the search function to find what you're looking for! Don't forget to check out the [Client Playback Settings](client-settings.md) to optimize your viewing.
