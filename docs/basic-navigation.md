# Basic Navigation & Libraries

Welcome! Once you're connected to the Jellyfin (*Parvati*) server (see [Connecting to the Server](connecting.md)), here's a quick guide to finding your way around the interface in most Jellyfin apps.

!!! note "Interface Variations"
    The exact layout might differ slightly between apps (Web browser, TV app, Mobile app), but the core concepts are generally the same.

## Finding Your Way Around

* **Home Screen:** This is usually your starting point. It often shows recently added items, items you're currently watching ("Continue Watching"), and may have suggested content or quick access to libraries. You can often customize the sections shown here in the app's settings.
* **Sidebar / Menu:** Most apps have a main menu, often accessed via a "Hamburger" icon (‚ò∞) on mobile/web, or as a persistent sidebar on TV/desktop apps. This is where you'll typically find direct links to the different media libraries.
* **Libraries:** These are the main categories of content. Click or select a library name (e.g., "Movies", "TV Shows") from the menu or home screen to browse its contents.
* **Search:** Look for a **Magnifying Glass icon** (üîç). This allows you to search across all your accessible libraries for specific titles, actors, directors, etc.
* **User Icon / Settings:** Your profile icon (often top-right or in the main menu) usually gives access to user-specific settings, including playback preferences, display settings, and logging out. See [Client Playback Settings](client-settings.md) for important quality adjustments.

## Library Descriptions

Here's a brief overview of the different media libraries available on the *Parvati* server:

* **Anime:** Features Japanese animated series and movies, covering a wide range of genres and styles.
* **R Anime:** Contains mature-rated (R or 18+) anime series and movies. This library is intended for adult audiences due to potentially explicit content (violence, themes, etc.).
* **TV Shows:** Your main library for episodic television series, primarily Western/English-language shows across various genres (comedy, drama, sci-fi, etc.).
* **Asian Shows:** Features television dramas and series originating from various Asian countries (e.g., Korea, China, Japan), excluding anime. Includes K-Dramas, C-Dramas, J-Dramas, etc.
* **Shorts:** A collection of short films, animated shorts, standalone specials, or brief video clips that don't fit into standard movie or TV categories.
* **Audio Books:** Contains narrated book recordings for listening enjoyment, typically organized by author or title. Use a compatible Jellyfin music client or the web player for playback.

* **Indian Movies:** Features feature-length films originating from India (Bollywood, Tollywood, Kollywood etc.), encompassing diverse languages and cinematic styles.
* **Foreign Movies:** Contains non-English language feature films from around the world (excluding Indian cinema, which has its own libraries). Subtitles are generally available and recommended.
* **Documentary:** Feature-length non-fiction films exploring real-world topics, events, nature, history, science, or people.
* **Documentary Shows:** Episodic non-fiction television series covering various subjects, similar to the Documentary movie library but in a series format.
