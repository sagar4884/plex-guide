# Setting Video Quality (Roku App)

To configure the video quality settings in the official Jellyfin app for Roku devices:

1.  **Open Jellyfin App:** Launch the Jellyfin channel on your Roku.
2.  **Navigate to Settings:** Use your Roku remote to navigate to your **User Profile icon** (usually in the top right or accessible from a sidebar). Select **Settings** (often a Gear icon ⚙️).
3.  **Select Playback:** Within the Settings menu, find and select the **Playback** section.
4.  **Adjust Video Quality:** Look for the quality settings:
    * **Internet Quality / Remote Quality:** Set this to the **highest available option** (e.g., "Maximum", "Original", or the highest Mbps value shown).
    * **Home Network Quality / Local Quality:** Set this also to the **highest available option**.
5.  **Check Direct Play/Stream:** Ensure options like "Allow Direct Stream" or "Force Direct Play" are configured appropriately. Often, leaving these at default or "Auto" is fine, as Roku has specific format limitations. If you experience unnecessary transcoding, you might experiment here, but start with just maximizing the quality settings.
6.  **Exit Settings:** Settings are usually saved automatically. Navigate back using your remote.

Setting the quality to maximum helps ensure the Roku app tries to play the original file first. Due to Roku's specific hardware and software limitations, transcoding might still occur more often than on other platforms, but these settings give it the best chance to direct play.
