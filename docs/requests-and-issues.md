# Requesting Content & Reporting Issues

This page explains how to request new movies or TV shows and how to report problems with content already available on the server. Both actions are best handled through the dedicated request tool.

**Request Tool URL:** [request.bladelight.tech](https://request.bladelight.tech)

## Requesting New Content

You can request new Movies or TV Shows using the tool linked above.

1.  **Visit the Request Tool:** Go to [request.bladelight.tech](https://request.bladelight.tech). You may need to log in (use the same credentials you use for this guide/Jellyfin).
2.  **Search:** Look for the Movie or TV Show you'd like to add.
3.  **Request:** Click the **Request** button for the desired item. If requesting a TV show, you might be able to request specific seasons or the entire series.

Requests are typically reviewed regularly. If the content is available digitally and approved, it should appear in the Jellyfin library shortly after. Availability depends on release dates and sources.

!!! note "Regarding Watchlists (Plex vs. Jellyfin)"
    * **Plex:** Adding items to your Plex Universal Watchlist *may* have previously triggered automatic requests via the tool.
    * **Jellyfin:** Jellyfin does not have a direct equivalent to the Plex Universal Watchlist that automatically syncs for requests in the same way. While the request tool might offer ways to import or manage watchlists, the most reliable way to request content for Jellyfin is by using the search and request buttons directly within the tool at [request.bladelight.tech](https://request.bladelight.tech).

!!! important "Login Requirement for Request Tool Features"
    Some features of the requesting tool (like seeing request status or potential watchlist syncing) might require you to log into [request.bladelight.tech](https://request.bladelight.tech) periodically (e.g., at least once every 90 days, depending on the tool's settings) for it to maintain connection with your account or sync data.

## Reporting Issues with Existing Content

If you encounter any problems while watching (e.g., distorted video, incorrect audio track, wrong episode/movie, missing subtitles, audio sync issues), please report it so it can be fixed.

**Preferred Method: Using the Request Tool**

This helps track issues effectively.

1.  **Visit the Request Tool:** Go to [request.bladelight.tech](https://request.bladelight.tech) and log in if needed.
2.  **Find Item:** Search for the Movie or TV Show that has the problem.
3.  **View Details:** Click on the item to view its details page.
4.  **Report Issue:** Look for a **Report Issue** button or icon (often a yellow exclamation point ⚠️ or similar). Click it.
5.  **Describe Problem:** Clearly explain the issue. Be specific! Examples:
    * "Audio is out of sync starting around the 10-minute mark."
    * "Video freezes but audio continues after 1 hour."
    * "This is the wrong movie, it's actually [Correct Movie Title]."
    * "Episode S02E05 is actually S02E06."
    * "English subtitles are missing."
6.  **Submit:** Submit the issue report.
