# Setting Video Quality (Desktop App - Jellyfin Media Player)

Jellyfin Media Player (JMP) is the recommended official desktop client for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It generally offers the best compatibility and performance. Here's how to check its quality settings:

1.  **Open Jellyfin Media Player:** Launch the JMP application.
2.  **Login:** Connect to your server (`https://jellyfin.bladelight.tech`) and log in if you haven't already.
3.  **Open Settings:** Click on the **User Icon** in the top-right corner.
4.  **Select Settings:** From the dropdown menu, choose **Settings**.
5.  **Select Playback:** In the settings menu on the left, click on **Playback**.
6.  **Adjust Quality Settings:**
    * **Internet Streaming Quality / Remote Quality:** Set this to the **Maximum** possible value (highest bitrate or "Maximum").
    * **Home Network Quality / Local Quality:** Set this also to the **Maximum** possible value.
7.  **Check Player Settings (Important for JMP):**
    * **Hardware Decoding:** Ensure this is **Enabled** (or set to Auto) if your computer supports it (most modern ones do). This helps playback performance significantly.
    * **Sync Mode:** For best results on most displays, "Display Sync" is often recommended, but "Audio" sync can also work well. Experiment if you notice issues.
8.  **Save Changes:** Click the **Save** button at the bottom if available (some settings save automatically).

Jellyfin Media Player is designed to direct play most formats, so ensuring quality settings are at maximum allows it to do so whenever possible.
