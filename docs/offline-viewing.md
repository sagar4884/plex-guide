# Offline Viewing (Downloads/Sync)

Jellyfin allows you to download media to certain client devices for offline viewing, which is perfect for flights, commutes, or areas with poor internet connectivity.

!!! note "Feature Availability"
    * This feature must be **enabled on the server** by the administrator. Assuming it is enabled here.
    * Download functionality is primarily available in the official **Jellyfin Mobile apps** (Android and iOS). Other clients (like TV apps or the web player) generally do not support downloading for offline playback.
    * Jellyfin sometimes refers to this as "Downloads" or "Sync".

## How to Download Media (Mobile Apps)

The exact steps might vary slightly between the Android and iOS Jellyfin apps, but the general process is:

1.  **Open Jellyfin App:** Launch the Jellyfin app on your phone or tablet and ensure you are logged in.
2.  **Find Media:** Navigate to the Movie or TV Show (or even specific Episode/Season) you want to download.
3.  **Look for Download Icon:** On the details page for the item, look for a **Download icon**. This is often represented by a downward-pointing arrow (⬇️ or similar).
4.  **Tap Download Icon:** Tap the icon to initiate the download.
5.  **Choose Quality/Version (If Prompted):** The app might ask you which version or quality you want to download, especially if the server has multiple versions available or if transcoding is needed to make it compatible for download. Choose the desired option.
6.  **Monitor Progress:** You can usually monitor download progress in a dedicated **Downloads** section within the app (check the main menu or settings area). Downloads happen in the background as long as the app is open (or allowed background activity).
7.  **Access Downloads:** Once completed, downloaded items will be available in the **Downloads** section of the app for offline playback. You should be able to watch them even when your device is in airplane mode or has no internet connection.

## Managing Downloads

* **Storage:** Downloads consume storage space on your device. Be mindful of available space.
* **Deleting:** You can usually delete downloaded items from the Downloads section within the app to free up space. Look for delete icons or options when viewing your downloaded media.
* **Settings:** Check the app's **Settings** menu for download-related options, such as:
    * Setting default download quality.
    * Limiting downloads to Wi-Fi only.
    * Specifying download location (on Android, if storage options are available).

Enjoy your media on the go!
