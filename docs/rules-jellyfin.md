# Rules and Guidelines for using the Media Server

There are only 2 main rules, please follow them closely:

**1. Don't Talk About the Server or Share Your Account:**

* Sharing your account credentials with others is strictly prohibited and can cause your account to be banned.
* Server resources (like transcoding power and network bandwidth) are finite. Sharing accounts can negatively impact streaming performance for everyone.
* Please maintain discretion about the server's existence and your access.

    * *First Occurrence* - Temporary account lockout (e.g., 24 Hours)
    * *Second Occurrence* - Longer lockout (e.g., 1 Week)
    * *Third Occurrence* - Account disabled until you contact the administrator.

**2. DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SERVER OR SHARE YOUR ACCOUNT!**

Following these simple rules ensures a smooth and stable experience for all users. Thank you for your cooperation!
